Steps for building a new release of SQuirreL

It's important to note that the snapshot build mechanism is to be used for 
building all new releases of SQuirreL that are uploaded to SF.  The reason
for this is that it prepares a fresh checkout of the source repository and 
replaces certain parameterized files in order to ensure that the build isn't
tainted with local changes.

1. Update Version.java to contain the correct version

In the snapshot directory, update build-weekly.properties as follows:

1. set appversion to the correct version

2. set replace.version=false

3. set cvs.dest.dir to some directory where the result of the build will be stored

4. run "ant -f build-weekly.xml"

5. During the build process, the installer that is produced will be executed
   and SQuirreL will be installed and launched automatically.  It is a good 
   idea at this point to do a sanity check.  Check the version to make sure
   it is correct.  Look for something that changed (maybe a bug that was fixed
   and see that it appears to be fixed in this build).  If everything is good
   quit SQuirreL and the build process will continue by creating a source archive.
   If something appears to be wrong with the build, quit SQuirreL and Ctrl-C 
   will stop the rest of the build.

6. When the build completes the install jar and source archive will be 
   ${cvs.dest.dir}/squirrel-sql-dist
