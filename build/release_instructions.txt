Steps for building a new release of SQuirreL

It's important to note that the snapshot build mechanism is to be used for 
building all new releases of SQuirreL that are uploaded to SF.  The reason
for this is that it prepares a fresh checkout of the source repository and 
replaces certain parameterized files in order to ensure that the build isn't
tainted with local changes.

Pre-build prep:

  1. Update Version.java to contain the correct version.

  2. Add version header to doc/changes.txt with the date of release.
  
  3. Update version in snapshot_release_notes.template.(Not required but will 
     be needed for the next snapshot, so it's good to do it while we are here)

In the snapshot directory, update build-weekly.properties as follows:

  1. set appversion to the correct version

  2. set replace.version=false

  3. set cvs.dest.dir to some directory where the result of the build will be stored

  4. run "ant -f build-weekly.xml"

  5. During the build process, the installer that is produced will be executed
   and SQuirreL will be installed and launched automatically.  It is a good 
   idea at this point to do a sanity check.  Check the version to make sure
   it is correct.  Look for something that changed (maybe a bug that was fixed
   and see that it appears to be fixed in this build).  If everything is good
   quit SQuirreL and the build process will continue by creating a source archive.
   If something appears to be wrong with the build, quit SQuirreL and Ctrl-C 
   will stop the rest of the build. (Note: IzPack 3.9.0 installers throws an NPE 
   when the installer is run in auto-install using the auto-install xml file.  
   This is ok since the software is still installed correctly, it just looks ugly 
   to have the stack trace appear in the Ant output).

  6. When the build completes the install jars (generic and Mac OS X) and source 
   archive will be ${cvs.dest.dir}/squirrel-sql-dist
   
  7. If this is not a snapshot release, then additional archived versions need to 
   be prepared.  These are the "extract and run" no-installer archives that 
   many people seem to prefer over the installer.
   
Additional Steps for Non-Snapshot release:

  1. Modify build/plainzip/build.bat and build/plainzip/build.sh to have the 
   correct version and local path to the installer created by step 4. above.
   
  2. On Linux run build.sh, on Windows run build.bat ( there is no script to run
   on Mac OS X)  This will product 3 software archive files on each platform.
   They are the base-only, base & standard plugins, base & all standard/optional
   plugins archive files.
