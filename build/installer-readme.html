<BODY>

<P><B>SQuirreL SQL Client</B> is a graphical Java program that will allow
you to view the structure of a JDBC compliant database, browse the
data in tables, issue SQL commands etc. It is free software, and you
are welcome to redistribute it under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</P>

<P>From version 1.1 on SQuirreL SQL Client requires JDK1.3. There are a
number of problems with JDK1.3.0 so it is recommended that you use
JDK1.3.1 or preferably JDK1.4. If you need a version compatible with
JDK1.2 download SquirreL SQL Client 1.0.</P>

<P>Some people have reported core dumps with the Sun JDK1.3.1 running
under Linux. If this happens passing the -classic flag to the java
executable appears to fix the problem. No similar problems have been
reported with any other JDK on Linux.</P>

<P>For Windows the file squirrel-sql.bat will run the application. For
Unix the file is squirrel-sql.sh. On some operating systems a
&quot;shortcut&quot; will be created in the menu system as part of the
installation process.</P>
