<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The DB2 plugin adds DB2-specific functionality to the SQuirreL SQL
Client for IBM DB2 hosted on LUW (Linux, Unix, Windows) and OS/400. Read access is 
required to the following system views in order for this additional 
functionality to work correctly on LUW DB2:
<UL>
<li>SYSCAT.DATATYPES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.INDEXES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.PROCEDURES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.SEQUENCES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.TABLES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.TABLESPACES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.TRIGGERS</li>
<li>SYSCAT.VIEWS</li>
</UL>

and the following system views on OS/400 DB2:

<UL>
<li>QSYS2.SYSFUNCS</li>
<li>QSYS2.SYSINDEXES</li>
<li>QSYS2.SYSROUTINES</li>
<li>QSYS2.SYSSEQUENCES</li>
<li>QSYS2.SYSVIEWS</li>
</UL>

<H2>New Tabs</H2>

<P>Stored Procedures, Triggers, Views and User-defined Functions (UDFs) are 
shown in the object tree and have a &quot;Source&quot; tab which displays 
the source of the selected object and a &quot;Details&quot; tab which gives 
DB2-specific information about the object.  Tables and Materialized Query Tables
are shown in the object tree and have a &quot;Source&quot; tab which displays
the source of the selected object. Sequences and Indexes are also shown in the 
object tree and have a details tab giving DB2-specific information about them.  

<!-- INDEX -->

<h2>Index Details Tab</h2>
The index details tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree to the INDEX
folder beneath any table that has one or multiple indexes.  The index(es) will 
be listed by name under the table folder, and selecting one will place a 
details tab in the right-hand view of the session window.
<p>

<p>
The information provided by the details tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query on LUW DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT T1.IID as index_identifier, 
	       T1.DEFINER AS index_owner, 
	       T1.INDNAME AS index_name, 
	       T2.DEFINER AS table_owner, 
	       T2.TABNAME AS table_name, 
	       T3.TBSPACE AS table_space, 
	       case T1.INDEXTYPE 
	         when 'BLOK' then 'Block Index' 
	         when 'CLUS' then 'Clustering Index' 
	         when 'DIM' then 'Dimension Block Index' 
	         when 'REG' then 'Regular Index' 
	         when 'XPTH' then 'XML Path Index' 
	         when 'XRGN' then 'XML Region Index' 
	         when 'XVIL' then 'Index over XML column (Logical)' 
	         when 'XVIP' then 'Index over XML column (Physical)' 
	       end AS index_type, 
	       case T1.UNIQUERULE 
	         when 'U' then 'UNIQUE' 
	         when 'D' then 'NON-UNIQUE' 
	         when 'I' then 'UNIQUE (Implements PK)' 
	       end AS uniqueness, 
	       T1.NLEAF AS number_of_leaf_pages, 
	       T1.NLEVELS AS number_of_levels, 
	       T1.CREATE_TIME, 
	       T1.STATS_TIME AS last_statistics_update,

	         when 'Y' then 'Supported' 
	         when 'N' then 'Not Supported' 
	       end AS reverse_scans 
	FROM    SYSCAT.INDEXES   AS T1, 
	        SYSCAT.TABLES    AS T2, 
	        SYSCAT.TABLESPACES as T3 
	WHERE  T3.TBSPACEID = T1.TBSPACEID 
	and T2.TABNAME = T1.TABNAME 
	and T2.TABSCHEMA = T1.TABSCHEMA 
	AND     T1.TABSCHEMA = ? 
	AND     T1.INDNAME = ? 
</pre>

and the following query on OS/400 DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	select index_owner, 
	index_name, 
	index_schema, 
	table_owner, 
	table_name, 
	table_schema, 
	case is_unique 
	    when 'D' then 'No (duplicates are allowed)' 
	    when 'V' then 'Yes (duplicate NULL values are allowed)' 
	    when 'U' then 'Yes' 
	    when 'E' then 'Encoded vector index' 
	end as uniqueness, 
	column_count, 
	system_index_name, 
	system_index_schema, 
	system_table_name, 
	system_table_schema, 
	long_comment, 
	iasp_number, 
	index_text, 
	is_spanning_index 
	from qsys2.sysindexes 
	where table_schema = ? 
	and index_name = ? 
</pre>

<p>

<!-- STORED PROC SOURCE -->

<h2>Stored Procedure Source Tab</h2>
The Stored Procedure Source tab can be accessed by navigating to a catalog, 
then to a schema and finally to the PROCEDURE folder beneath the schema.  In 
the following picture, the schema is &quot;dbcopy&quot;
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/procedure_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for stored procedures is derived by the following query on LUW DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	select text 
	from SYSCAT.PROCEDURES 
	where PROCSCHEMA = ? 
	and PROCNAME = ? 
</pre>
<p>
and the following query on OS/400 DB2:
<pre>
	select routine_definition from qsys2.sysroutines 
	where routine_schema=? 
	and routine_name = ? 
</pre>
<p>
<!-- SEQUENCE -->

<h2>Sequence Details Tab</h2>
Sequences will appear in the object tree under the SCHEMA folder. The details 
tab for sequences displays information about the selected sequence according 
to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/sequence_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a sequence is derived from the following
query on LUW DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT  T1.OWNER     AS sequence_owner, 
	        T1.DEFINER   AS sequence_definer, 
	       T1.SEQNAME   AS sequence_name, 
	       T2.TYPENAME AS data_type,

	         when 'U' then 'User' 
	         when 'S' then 'System' 
	       end AS origin,

	FROM    SYSCAT.SEQUENCES AS T1, 
	        SYSCAT.DATATYPES AS T2 
	WHERE T1.DATATYPEID = T2.TYPEID 
	and T1.SEQSCHEMA = ? 
	and T1.SEQNAME = ? 
</pre>
<p>
and the following query on OS/400 DB2:
<pre>
	select sequence_schema, 
	sequence_name, 
	sequence_definer, 
	data_type as type_name, 
	minimum_value as min_value, 
	maximum_value as max_value, 
	increment as increment_by, 
	case cycle_option 
	 when 'YES' then 'CYCLE'

	sequence_created as create_time, 
	last_altered_timestamp as last_alter_time, 
	long_comment as comment 
	from qsys2.syssequences 
</pre>

<!-- TRIGGER SOURCE -->

<h2>Trigger Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for triggers displays the source for a table trigger and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;TRIGGER&quot; folder beneath a table 
object in the object tree.  Currently, trigger features of this plugin are only 
supported on LUW DB2.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for triggers is derived from the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select TEXT from SYSCAT.TRIGGERS 
	where TABSCHEMA = ? 
	and TRIGNAME = ?
</pre>
<p>

<!-- TRIGGER DETAILS -->

<h2>Trigger Details Tab</h2>
The details tab for triggers displays information about the selected trigger 
according to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a trigger is derived from the following
query:

	FROM    SYSCAT.TRIGGERS  AS T1, 
	       SYSCAT.TABLES    AS T2 
	WHERE   T2.TABNAME = T1.TABNAME 
	and T2.TABSCHEMA = T1.TABSCHEMA 
	and T1.TRIGSCHEMA = ? 
	and T1.trigname = ? 
</pre>

<!-- VIEW SOURCE -->

<h2>View Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for views and MQTs (Materialized Query Tables) displays the 
source for a view/MQT and can be accessed by navigating to the 
&quot;VIEW&quot;/&quot;MQT&quot; folder beneath a schema object in the 
object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/view_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for views/MQTs is derived from the following query on LUW DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT TEXT 
	FROM SYSCAT.VIEWS 
	WHERE VIEWSCHEMA = ? 
	AND VIEWNAME = ? 
</pre>
and the following query on OS/400 DB2:

	from qsys2.sysviews 
	where table_schema = ? 
	and table_name = ? 
</pre>
<p>

<!-- UDF SOURCE -->
<h2>UDF Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for UDFs displays the source for a User-defined function and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;UDF&quot; folder beneath a schema 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/udf_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for a UDF is derived from the following query on LUW DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT 
	case 
	    when body is null then 'No source available' 
	    else body 
	end 
	FROM SYSIBM.SYSFUNCTIONS 
	WHERE schema = ? 
	AND name = ? 
	AND implementation is null
</pre>
and the following query on OS/400 DB2:
<p>
<pre>
	select 
	case 
	    when body = 'SQL' and routine_definition is not null then routine_definition 
	    when body = 'SQL' and routine_definition is null then 'no source available' 
	    when body = 'EXTERNAL' and external_name is not null then external_name
