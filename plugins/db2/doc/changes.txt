DB2 Plugin Change Log
=====================

0.03
====
- Added support for OS/400 (trigger source and details not yet implemented). 
  Special thanks goes to Tilmann Brenk for submitting OS/400 versions of all SQL 
  statements required to support the plugin features.
- Added support for showing user-defined functions in the object tree and the 
  source code that is associated with them if it is available.
- When the source tab of a C-language stored procedure is selected, we now 
  show the user a nice informative message stating that the source code is 
  unavailable instead of merely displaying the word "null".

0.02
====

- Exceptions from DB2 Universal JDBC driver are now interpreted as DB2Diagnoseable
  exceptions so that the cause of the exception can be printed (Thanks to 
  Christoph Schmitz)

0.01
====

- Initial release.
