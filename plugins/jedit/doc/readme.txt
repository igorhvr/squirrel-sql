jEdit Text Area Plugin
======================
This plugin adds additional functionality such as syntax
highlighting, bracket matching and more to the SQL entry
area. It uses code from the jEdit (http://www.jedit.org)
text editor and from the Jalopy (http://jalopy.sourceforge.net)
and BlueJ (http://www.bluej.org) projects.

The jEdit plugin can be configured through the jEdit tabs on the
"New Session" and Session properties dialogs.
