jEdit Text Area Plugin
======================
This plugin replaces the standard Java text area control with one from the
jEdit (www.jedit.org) text editor. Additional features include syntax
highlighting, bracket matching and much more.

The jEdit plugin can be configured through the jEdit tabs on the
"New Session" and Session properties dialogs.
