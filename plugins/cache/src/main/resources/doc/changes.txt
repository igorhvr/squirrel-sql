Plugin for the Intersystems Cache DB

Thanks to Andreas Schneider for making the source code available for SQuirreL. 

Currently this plugin should work for Cache 5 Versions

Features:
- Viewing Namespaces and creating Aliases for them
- Viewing Cache Processes together with locks. Processes may be terminated. 
- Scripting Views and Procedures either as DDL or CDL
- Viewing Query Plans for SQL Statement

To make the Plugin work properly you must copy the Cache-JDBC-Driver Jar to SQuirreL's lib directory
