<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The H2 plugin adds H2-specific functionality to the SQuirreL SQL
Client. Read access is required to the following system views in order for this
additional functionality to work correctly:
<UL>
<li>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES</li>
<li>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEQUENCES</li>
<li>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS</li>
<li>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS</li>
</UL>

<H2>New Tabs</H2>

<P>Indexes and Views are shown in the object tree and have 
a &quot;Source&quot; tab which displays the source of the selected object and 
a &quot;Details&quot; tab which gives H2-specific information about the 
object.  Sequences and Indexes are also shown in the object tree and have a 
details tab giving H2-specific information about them.  

<!-- INDEX -->

<h2>Index Details Tab</h2>
The index details tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree to the INDEX
folder beneath any table that has one or multiple indexes.  The index(es) will 
be listed by name under the table folder, and selecting one will place a 
details tab in the right-hand view of the session window.

<p>
The information provided by the details tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT TABLE_CATALOG,TABLE_SCHEMA,TABLE_NAME, 
	NON_UNIQUE,ORDINAL_POSITION,COLUMN_NAME, 
	CARDINALITY,PRIMARY_KEY,INDEX_TYPE_NAME, 
	IS_GENERATED,INDEX_TYPE,ASC_OR_DESC,PAGES, 
	FILTER_CONDITION,REMARKS 
	FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES 
	WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = ? 
	AND INDEX_NAME = ? 
</pre>
<p>


<h2>Index Source Tab</h2>
The index source tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree as above and
selecting the "Source" tab which is adjacent to the "Details" tab. An example
is shown below:

<p>
The information provided by the source tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select 
	'create '||index_type_name||' '||index_name||' ON '||table_name||'('||column_name||')' 
	from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES 
	where table_schema = ? 
	and index_name = ? 
</pre>
<p>



<!-- SEQUENCE -->

<h2>Sequence Details Tab</h2>
Sequences will appear in the object tree under the SCHEMA folder. The details 
tab for sequences displays information about the selected sequence according 
to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/sequence_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a sequence is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT SEQUENCE_CATALOG,SEQUENCE_SCHEMA, 
	CURRENT_VALUE,INCREMENT,IS_GENERATED,REMARKS 
	FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEQUENCES 
	WHERE SEQUENCE_SCHEMA = ? 
	AND SEQUENCE_NAME = ? 
</pre>

<p>

<!-- TRIGGER DETAILS -->

<h2>Trigger Details Tab</h2>
The details tab for triggers displays information about the selected trigger 
according to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a trigger is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT TRIGGER_CATALOG,TRIGGER_SCHEMA,TRIGGER_NAME, 
	TRIGGER_TYPE,TABLE_CATALOG,TABLE_SCHEMA,TABLE_NAME, 
	BEFORE,JAVA_CLASS,QUEUE_SIZE,NO_WAIT,REMARKS,SQL 
	FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS 
	WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = ? 
	AND TRIGGER_NAME = ? 
</pre>

<!-- VIEW SOURCE -->

<h2>View Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for views displays the source for a view and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;VIEW&quot; folder beneath a schema 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/view_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for views is derived from the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select view_definition 
	from information_schema.views 
	where table_schema = ? 
	and table_name = ? 
</pre>
