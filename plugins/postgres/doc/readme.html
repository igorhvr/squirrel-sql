<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The DB2 plugin adds DB2-specific functionality to the SQuirreL SQL
Client. Read access is required to the following system views in order for this
additional functionality to work correctly:
<UL>
<li>SYSCAT.DATATYPES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.INDEXES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.PROCEDURES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.SEQUENCES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.TABLES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.TABLESPACES</li>
<li>SYSCAT.TRIGGERS</li>
<li>SYSCAT.VIEWS</li>


</UL>

<H2>New Tabs</H2>

<P>Stored Procedures, Triggers and Views are shown in the object tree and have 
a &quot;Source&quot; tab which displays the source of the selected object and 
a &quot;Details&quot; tab which gives DB2-specific information about the 
object.  Sequences and Indexes are also shown in the object tree and have a 
details tab giving DB2-specific information about them.  

<!-- INDEX -->

<h2>Index Details Tab</h2>
The index details tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree to the INDEX
folder beneath any table that has one or multiple indexes.  The index(es) will 
be listed by name under the table folder, and selecting one will place a 
details tab in the right-hand view of the session window.

<p>
The information provided by the details tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT T1.IID as index_identifier, 
	       T1.DEFINER AS index_owner, 
	       T1.INDNAME AS index_name, 
	       T2.DEFINER AS table_owner, 
	       T2.TABNAME AS table_name, 
	       T3.TBSPACE AS table_space, 
	       case T1.INDEXTYPE 
	         when 'BLOK' then 'Block Index' 
	         when 'CLUS' then 'Clustering Index' 
	         when 'DIM' then 'Dimension Block Index' 
	         when 'REG' then 'Regular Index' 
	         when 'XPTH' then 'XML Path Index' 
	         when 'XRGN' then 'XML Region Index' 
	         when 'XVIL' then 'Index over XML column (Logical)' 
	         when 'XVIP' then 'Index over XML column (Physical)' 
	       end AS index_type, 
	       case T1.UNIQUERULE 
	         when 'U' then 'UNIQUE' 
	         when 'D' then 'NON-UNIQUE' 
	         when 'I' then 'UNIQUE (Implements PK)' 
	       end AS uniqueness, 
	       T1.NLEAF AS number_of_leaf_pages, 
	       T1.NLEVELS AS number_of_levels, 
	       T1.CREATE_TIME, 
	       T1.STATS_TIME AS last_statistics_update, 
	       case T1.REVERSE_SCANS 
	         when 'Y' then 'Supported' 
	         when 'N' then 'Not Supported' 
	       end AS reverse_scans 
	FROM    SYSCAT.INDEXES   AS T1, 
	        SYSCAT.TABLES    AS T2, 
	        SYSCAT.TABLESPACES as T3 
	WHERE  T3.TBSPACEID = T1.TBSPACEID 
	and T2.TABNAME = T1.TABNAME 
	and T2.TABSCHEMA = T1.TABSCHEMA 
	AND     T1.TABSCHEMA = ? 
	AND     T1.INDNAME = ? 
</pre>
<p>

<!-- STORED PROC SOURCE -->

<h2>Stored Procedure Source Tab</h2>
The Stored Procedure Source tab can be accessed by navigating to a catalog, 
then to a schema and finally to the PROCEDURE folder beneath the schema.  In 
the following picture, the schema is &quot;dbcopy&quot;
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/procedure_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for stored procedures is derived by the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select text 
	from SYSCAT.PROCEDURES 
	where PROCSCHEMA = ? 
	and PROCNAME = ? 
</pre>

<!-- SEQUENCE -->

<h2>Sequence Details Tab</h2>
Sequences will appear in the object tree under the SCHEMA folder. The details 
tab for sequences displays information about the selected sequence according 
to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/sequence_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a sequence is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT  T1.OWNER     AS sequence_owner, 
	        T1.DEFINER   AS sequence_definer, 
	       T1.SEQNAME   AS sequence_name, 
	       T2.TYPENAME AS data_type, 
	       T1.MINVALUE   AS min_value, 
	       T1.MAXVALUE   AS max_value, 
	       T1.INCREMENT   AS increment_by, 
	       case T1.CYCLE 
	         when 'Y' then 'CYCLE' 
	         else 'NOCYCLE' 
	       end AS cycle_flag, 
	       case T1.ORDER 
	         when 'Y' then 'ORDERED' 
	         else 'UNORDERED' 
	        end AS order_flag, 
	       T1.CACHE AS cache_size, 
	       T1.CREATE_TIME AS create_time, 
	       T1.ALTER_TIME AS last_alter_time, 
	       case T1.ORIGIN 
	         when 'U' then 'User' 
	         when 'S' then 'System' 
	       end AS origin, 
	       T1.REMARKS AS comment 
	FROM    SYSCAT.SEQUENCES AS T1, 
	        SYSCAT.DATATYPES AS T2 
	WHERE T1.DATATYPEID = T2.TYPEID 
	and T1.SEQSCHEMA = ? 
	and T1.SEQNAME = ? 
</pre>

<!-- TRIGGER SOURCE -->

<h2>Trigger Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for triggers displays the source for a table trigger and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;TRIGGER&quot; folder beneath a table 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_source.jpg">

<p>
The source code for triggers is derived from the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select TEXT from SYSCAT.TRIGGERS 
	where TABSCHEMA = ? 
	and TRIGNAME = ?
</pre>

<!-- TRIGGER DETAILS -->

<h2>Trigger Details Tab</h2>
The details tab for triggers displays information about the selected trigger 
according to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:

	       T2.TABNAME   AS table_name, 
	       case T2.TYPE 
	         when 'T' then 'TABLE'

<!-- VIEW SOURCE -->

<h2>View Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for views displays the source for a view and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;VIEW&quot; folder beneath a schema 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
