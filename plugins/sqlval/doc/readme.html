<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This plugin will validate your SQL against the ISO SQL standard. It
does this by using a Web Service provided by Mimer SQL. The SQL that is
validated is stored anonymously to be used by the ISO SQL Standards
committee.</P>

<P>If you can't connect to the SQL Validation web service then you
may need to specify a proxy server in the &quot;Proxy&quot; tab of the Global
Preferences dialog.</P>

<P>For more information
on the web service consult the Mimer SQL Validation <A HREF="http://sqlvalidator.mimer.com">web site</A>.</P>

<p><EM>Note</EM> If you use this plugin with JDK 1.3 you will need a
JAXP 1.1 XML compliant parser such as <A
	HREF="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">xml-xerces</A> or the <A
	HREF="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/index.html"> JAXP 1.1 reference
	implementation</A>. Copy the jar files from your XML parser to the
directory &lt;squirrel-sql&gt;/plugins/sqlval/lib. For xml-xerces this
should be xerces.jar and for JAXP 1.1 reference implementation this
should be crimson.jar and jaxp.jar.</p>

<H2>New Global Preferences Tab</H2>

<P>The Global Preferences dialog has a new &quot;SQL Validator&quot; tab.
This specifies the information to send to the Web Service. You can either
logon anonymously or use a user name and password that have been supplied
to you by Mimer SQL.</P>

<P>You can choose whether to send client details to the Web Service. If the
&quot;Anonymous Client&quot; checkbox is unchecked then the Client and
Version details shown will be sent to the Web Service along with your
validation request otherwise &quot;N/A&quot; will be sent for these
fields.</P>

<H2>New Menu Items</H2>

<P>An &quot;SQL Validation&quot; hierarchical menu has been added to the
&quot;Session&quot; menu. This has the following menu items:

<DL>
<DT><B>Connect to SQL Validator</B>
<DD>This will present you with a &quot;logon&quot; dialog and allow you
	to connect to the SQL Validation web service. If you have already
	connected then the previous connection will first be closed.

<DT><B>Disconnect from SQL Validator</B>
<DD>If you have previously connected to the SQL Validation web service
	then this option will disconnect you.

<DT><B>Validate SQL</B>
<DD>This option will attempt to validate the current SQL in the
	SQL entry area. If you aren't connected to the SQL Validation web service
	then it will first display a &quot;logon&quot; dialog to allow you to
	connect. Results are shown in the message area at the bottom of the session
	window. This option has also been added to the popup menu in the SQL entry
	area.
