Informix Plugin Change Log
==========================

0.03
====
- 1732161 (Source code of procedures and triggers) Fixed to work with 
Informix version 7.31, which requires that "ORDER BY" columns also appear in the
"SELECT" clause. 
- When executing an SQL statement with a syntax error, the driver is now asked
to provide the position of the error in the statement.  If it is available, the
cursor is moved to the position of the incorrect syntax.

0.02
====
- Fixed to work with IDS 9 - qualified references to all system views by 
  prefixing them with the string 'informix.' (no quotes).
- Fixed ordering segements within the body of Stored Procedures.  
- Applied code formatting to triggers and view source.  
- Fixed erroneous inclusion of extra whitespace which for some definitions made
the SQL invalid.
