<h3>The Handwritten Font "&AElig;nigma Scrawl"</h3>

<h4>&AElig;nigma Scrawl, Created by Brian Kent</h4>

<p> Thanks for Downloading &AElig;nigma Scrawl.

<p> If you have any questions or comments, you can e-mail me at <a
        href="mailto:kentpw@norwich.net">kentpw@norwich.net</a>

<p> You can visit my Homepage <a href="http://www.aenigmafonts.com/">&lt;&AElig;NIGMA
    GAMES & FONTS&gt;</a> at <a href="http://www.aenigmafonts.com/">http://www.aenigmafonts.com/</a>

<h4>NOTE</h4>

<p> This font has been updated! I've edited the (BRK) in the font name to just
    BRK. It seems that Adobe Illustrator and web pages with CSS don't like fonts
    with <tt>(</tt> and <tt>)</tt> in their name.

<h4>INSTALLING FONTS</h4>

<p> There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to install fonts
    is to just Unzip/place the font file [<tt>.ttf</tt>] into your <tt>Windows\Fonts</tt>
    directory (I always use this method). If you're unable to do it the 'easy'
    way, then try to do it this way (for Windows 95/98/NT):

<ol>

    <li>Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where you
        unzipped it) on your Computer.

    <li>Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then CONTROL
        PANEL.

    <li>When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

    <li>When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

    <li>A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you unzipped
        the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK. Now the Font(s)
        are installed.

</ol>

<p> Now you can use the Font(s) in programs the utilize Fonts. Make sure that
    you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps (so the app will
    recognize the font). Sometimes you'll have to wait until you computer
    'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize fonts (Windows is sometimes slow
    to do that). You can refresh your computer quicker by going into Windows
    Explorer -or- My Computer and press F5 (or in the menubar select VIEW then
    REFRESH).

<h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>

<ul><li>The font(s) in this zip file were created by me (Brian Kent). All of my
    Fonts are Freeware, you can use them any way you want to (Personal use,
    Commercial use, or whatever).

    <li>If you have a Font related site and would like to offer my fonts on your
        site, go right ahead. All I ask is that you keep this text file intact
        with the Font.

    <li>You may not Sell or Distribute my Fonts for profit or alter them in any
        way without asking me first. [e-mail &mdash; <a
            href="mailto:kentpw@norwich.net">kentpw@norwich.net</a>]
