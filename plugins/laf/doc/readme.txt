Look and Feel Plugin
====================
This plugin allows you to select a Look and Feel other than the
default Java one. It also allows you to specify the fonts for the
different GUI elements. As well as allowing you to use the default
Look and Feels that come with your Java environment allowing, it
ships with the following Look and Feel implementations:

Kunststoff 2.0.1   http://www.incors.org
Metouia 1.0beta    http://mlf.sourceforge.net
Oyoaha 3.0rc1      http://www.oyoaha.com
Skin 1.2.2         http://www.l2fprod.com

If you have other Look and Feel implementations that you would like
to use with SQuirreL drop the jar files into the plugins/laf
directory within your SQuirreL program directory and restart
SQuirreL.

Both the Skin and Oyoaha Look and Feels allow the use of "skins". Skin
Look and Feel themepacks should be placed in the
plugins/laf/skinlf-theme-packs directory within the SQuirreL program
directory and Oyoaha themes should be placed in the directory
plugins/laf/oyoaha-theme-packs.
