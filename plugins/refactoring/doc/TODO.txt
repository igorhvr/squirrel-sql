Refactoring TODO list:
=============================

Immediate:
==========

- Fix all of the TODOs involving user notification
- Figure out why the column list dialog doesn't have a scrollbar

Short Term:
==========

- For dropping columns allow the user to specify cascade / restrict for dbs that
  support it (like derby)
- Support quoted and qualified identifiers in the old/initial refactorings like
  Add/Modify/Remove Column and Add/Drop Primary Key.
  (use DatabaseObjectQualifier and SqlGenerationPreferences,
  for examples: look into the new refactorings and the new HibernateDialect methods from version 0.20)
- Allow the user to set some general refactoring preferences. (Qualify Identifiers, Quote Identifiers, etc.)
- Give the user some kind of feedback if a refactoring was successful.
- Give the user some kind of feedback on the progress of a complex refactoring
  like Add Lookup Table or Merge Table/Column. (maybe a fancy ProgressDialog?)

Long Term:
==========

- "Create Table" refactoring
- The rest of the dialects.
- Support operations that aren't directly support by the database (e.g. HADB
can't add/drop columns - simulate by creating new table and copying data - maybe
using dbcopy?)
