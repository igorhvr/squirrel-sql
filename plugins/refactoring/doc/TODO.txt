Refactoring TODO list:

Immediate:

- Fix all of the TODOs involving user notification
- Figure out why the column list dialog doesn't have a scrollbar

Short Term:

- For dropping columns allow the user to specify cascade / restrict for dbs that
  support it (like derby)

Long Term:

- Table refactorings
- The rest of the dialects.
- support operations that aren't directly support by the database (e.g. HADB
can't add/drop columns - simulate by creating new table and copying data - maybe
using dbcopy?)
