Tasks (Not necessarily in priority order)

1. Find a more reliable way to determine which Hibernate dialect to use for 
   a given JDBC driver (Right now, classname of the driver class is 
   hard-linked to the Hibernate dialect class).
   
2. Allow the user to append records to destination table, if it already has 
   records (Alternatively, allow user to specify tables are always truncated
   prior to copying records).
   
3. Allow user to override type mappings for table columns with a configuration 
   dialog.
   
4. Provide a way to "undo" the changes made to the destination database session
   during the copy operation.
   
5. Capture the state of the copy operation to allow a user to "continue" when 
   recovering from a failed copy operation (After they fix the problem themselves
   let them start copying again from the point where the copy failed).

6. Copy views (if the destination database supports them - MySQL 4.x doesn't)

7. Add rename column feature for table column names in source database that are
   keywords in the destination database.
