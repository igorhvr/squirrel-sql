This directory contains folders that each represent a package of related classes.  The goal here is to provide
class diagrams that deal with a logical sub-system of SQuirreL to provide a visual understanding of the source
code.  These models are all ArgoUML model files (*.zargo) and were composed with ArgoUML 0.26.2 (Get your 
open-source copy here : http://argouml.tigris.org).  The models have also been exported to image files (*.png) 
which can be displayed in a web-browser for convenience in case ArgoUML is not available.
