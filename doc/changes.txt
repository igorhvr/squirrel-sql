SQuirreL SQL Client Change Log
==============================


Not yet released, available in CVS and probably in latest weekly build
=======================================================================

Bug fix: When doing a complete refresh (F5) or a refresh item in the Object tree (see right mouse menu)
         code completion was not refreshed. 

Bug fix in Oracle Plugin: Avoided open cursors when viewing database output ( dbms_output.put_line() ).

1544447: (Generated SQL script Table names are not fully Qualified, it should
		 be "SCHEMA"."TABLE_NAME")  Added a new global preference panel and 
		 checkbox to make this alternative behavior configurable.  The default
		 now is to qualify table names with their schema name.

Bug fix: Stored procedures where not shown in Object Tree when the Oracle Plugin was used.

Bug fix: When a Schema was created and the Object Tree was refreshed the new Schema was not shown. 


Bug fix in Alias properties for Oracle:
  Note: This bug took effect when default Alias properties were used.
        So this fix probably increases Session startup performance for Oracle users
        who use the Oracle plugin but do not care for Alias properties.
  Bug: When an Alias was configured to load all Schemas and cache non
       but the Oracle Alias properties didn't allow to load all schemas
       SQuirreL still did load all tables and procedures from the database.
       Though the unallowed tables and procedures did not show up in the Object tree
       they still caused bad startup perfomance.
  Fix: Now only tables and procedures for allowed schemas are loaded.

Two new translations were added to the installer:
	Simplified Chinese (Thanks to xpdz)
	German (Thanks to Andreas Oswald)

1541154: (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in DataTypeDouble)

1533824: (NPE when loading keywords from DatabaseMetaData) Check the values
returned for null before attempting to parse and store them (DB2 driver
returns null for getCatalogTerm())

Export CVS allows to choose whether to use fromating from Global Prefs or default formatting.

Added new optional plugin (DBCopy) to the installer which allows database tables
and their content to be copied from one session to another inside of SQuirreL
using Copy/Paste menu items.

SQL result tabs offer to rerun their SQL query to update their data.

Text limit line of Netbeans editor can now be positioned or switched off in Session Properties.

2.3 rc1
=========


If an Alias is configured to Auto Logon but has wrong user name/password
  on connecting the user gets an error dialog and has to correct user name/password.
  For convenience the corrected data now is written back to the Alias.
  Note: The Writing back is only done when the Alias is configured to Auto Logon.  


Session startup performance
  General: New Alias properties allow to configure loading and caching of Schemas.
  Oracle: When the Oracle Plugin ist used an Oracle tab in Alias properties enables you
          to allow an Alias's Sessions only to see Schemas the user has access to.


Fixed bug #1504123: Oracle hints losts
  By default SQuirreL treads /*...*/ as comments and removes them before sending a SQL to a database.
  This default may now be changed in the (New) Session Properties. See Menu File --> New Session Properties --> Tab SQL.


Added toolbar button to toggle auto commit

Bug fixes in Oracle Plugin:
  - Explain Plan not visible in Results tab
  - Object tree: Sessions, Users and Instances and nodes sometimes not visible
  - Object tree: SYS Schema displayed twice for certain user rights
  - Fixed Memory Leak (Session were not garbage collected when Oracle Plugin was used)


Fixed bug #984527: Right mouse popup menu is now available in empty table. 

Feature request #1446675 Output tables to CSV files
  All tables' right mouse menus have an 'Export CVS ...' item.
  In the export dialog you may provide an application (like OpenOffice calc or MS Excel)
  to open the CSV file immediately after creation.

New toolbar button: Select current SQL (control Shift S)
 This function is based on SQuirreL's concept of 'current SQL': If there is no selected text the current SQL
 is the text between the empty line in fornt of cursor position and the empty line after cursor position.
 Any function that deals with SQL is aware of this concept.

Installer now includes the following optional translation packages:
- Brazilian Portuguese (contributed by Francis Martin)
- Czech (contributed by Jan Kostrhun)
- Bulgarian (contributed by Ivan Dimov)

Feature request #1441787 Quickly adopt column widths to column values
  when table header is double clicked while the resize mouse pointer (<-->) is visible. (MS Excel like)  

Enhancements of the Bookmarks Plugin
 - Bookmark preferences can be opened by the "Edit Bookmarks" button in the Session toolbar.
 - Bookmarks can be run from within the Bookmark Preferences.
 - Lots of "SQuirreL Bookmarks" which are templates for many common SQL/DDL statements.
 - User can decide if he wants to see "SQuirreL Bookmarks" in the Bookmarks selection popup of the SQL Editor (ctrl j).

Fixed bugs in error and syntax highlighting:
 - Error highlighting for "ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT ..."
 - Error highlighting for "CREATE VIEW ..."
 - Error and syntax highlighting for "CASE [...] WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE .. END"


Centralized Database Meta Data caching. This brings along the following improvements:
- When a DDL statement is run the Object Tree is updated immediately to reflect the change.
  This works as long as standard DDL statements are used.
- Syntax coloring and code completion for newly created tables, views, columns, procedures is available
  right after a DDL statement was run. This works as long as standard DDL statements are used.
- The Refresh button updates the Object tree as well as syntax highlighting and code completion.


Make the status message for rows affected by executing an SQL statement in the SQL panel
take into account the type of SQL query issued.

Fixed Bug #1472398: Content tab filters didn't work with views.


Fixed Bug #1465707: Programm slow with big Databases because reading Database Meta Data twice.
                    Technical detail: The SchemaInfo class has become SQuirreL's central meta data cache. 

Fixed Bug: SQuirreL crashed during building output of SQL results when errors occured in number-type or date-type fields.

Fixed Bug in Graph Plugin: In zoomed graphs lines with folding points could not be selected.


2.2 Final
=========


- Fixed Bug #1467671: Session Properties / General / Appearance: "SQL Results Tabs" overwrites
                     "SQL Execution Tabs" setting.

- Fixed Bug #1464361: Windows bat file is location specific (Thanks to Bill Wallace)

- Fixed Bug #1456423: Cannot cancel a query. Changed to allow the cancel operation to interrupt the
                     fetching of results.  While resolving the "hanging" of a long-running this also
                     allows results that have been fetched so far to be displayed.
                     This can help the user determine why the query was taking a long time to execute.
- Fixed Bug #1447231: ESCAPE key should close dialogs

- Fixed Bug #1457811: Autocomplete does not work for views when tables and view names match.

- Fixed Bug for Teradata not showing SQL results. (Thanks to Matthew Dahlman)

- Fixed Bug #1456463: update to allow the user to override the closing of a session in the event that
                    there are unsaved edits and they decide not to save them right away.  They can
                    always choose to not save and discard, closing the session immediately. This
                    change will make it so that if they choose to not discard, and something happens
                    during the save that causes the edits not to get saved, the session will not be
                    closed.  Added independently configurable options to warn when closing a session
                    if there are any unsaved edits (optional for File or Buffer).  If the
                    "Confirm Session Close" option is turned off, these can still be enabled so that
                    unsaved edits are never lost merely by closing a session.  Previously it was very
                    easy to lose changes made in the SQL edit tab when the session was closed.  This
                    previous behavior, if desired, is still available via Global Preferences.

- Fixed Bug #1441169: error in removing a deleted row more than once.

- Fixed Bug #1250514: Mysql Error: Cannot edit table.

2.2 RC1
=======

- There is now a printer icon in each SQL entry panel which will allow 
  the current sql script to be send to a printer.  Syntax highlighting
  is preserved.  SQL entry panel size is used to scale the font.

- Feature request #1441563 Query script generation:
  New entry for tables and views in the Objects tree's right mouse menu to create SELECT statements.  

- Added menu item and supporting capability to the SQLScripts plugin to 
  create a drop table script from the selected tables in the object tree.

- Added new property for drivers - website url - and a new menu item for 
  drivers to launch the system default web browser and load the driver 
  website url.

- When adding a new driver definition, SQuirreL will now look at the default 
  driver list and determine if any driver defs are missing from the user's
  personal list.  If so, SQuirreL will prompt the user to add them.

- MSSQL plugin: Scripting of procedures now works on MSSQL 2005

- Improved performance of the Session window when connecting to a database
  over a slow link (especially Oracle).  Instead of freezing the window, now
  SQuirreL indicates the progress of the session connection in the session
  frame status bar and allows the user to perform other tasks in parallel.
  Note: The session frame close button is temporarily ignored when the session
        is still loading and therefore not in a safe state to be closed. Once
        the session has been loaded, the close button will be re-enabled.

- Keyboard short cuts are shown in tool bar tool tips.

- Navigation through SQLs in SQL Editor by tool bar or Alt up/down keys.
  Note: The concept of an SQL in SQuirreL is the text between two empty lines. Many 
        functions in SQuirreL use this concept.  This way the user often doesn't 
        need to mark the text he wants to execute a function on.
        The concept is especially convenient for the Run SQL function (control Enter).

- Introduced Oracle specific code to allow editing of tables in Oracle that contain Date columns.
  Oracle stores time information in java.sql.Types.DATE columns. The where clauses that SQuirreL
  used to create to update data after editing only contained the Date part of those columns. That's why
  the where clause didn't match the database row and editing failed.

- SQL Editor: ctrl+backspace deletes word behind cursor.

- SQL Editor: To upper/lower case function available in tools pop up or by short cut ctrl+shift+u/l

- Row numbers in SQL result and Object Tree tables tables:
  Use the right mouse menu in SQL result tables or Object Tree tables to switch on row numbering.

- Improved handling of detached result windows:
  * By default result windows stay on top. A check box in the result window allows to change the default.
  * Result windows show up in the window list of the Windows menu and can be navigated to by Alt+left/right arrow.

- Added New, Close and Append icons/actions to allow the SQL Panel to function more
  like an editor.

- Added "Delete Records" menu item to the context menu for tables to delete all records
  in one or more selected tables.

- Installer now includes an optional Spanish translation package which provides native
  labels and messages for use in a Spanish locale.

- Cleaned up copying from tables:
  1. Control+c and copy in the right mouse menu now do the same: They copy data without column headers.
  2. A new right mouse menu entry ('Copy with headers') provides the ability to copy data including
     column headers
- Fixed bug #1450856: The "new" button has no icon  
- Fixed bug #1448345: Canceling "Save As... " option (overwrites file anyway)
- Fixed bug #1424828: Not possible to clear Non-nullable fields using backspace
- Fixed bug #1423029: Session window will not close for Postgresql
- Fixed bug #1409055: Copy as HTML in results tab does not set correct mime type
- Fixed bug #1403462: MS SQLServer Plugin throws NPE
- Fixed bug #1401672: NullPointerException when selecting Row IDs tab
- Fixed bug #1399254: Missing i18n strings
- Fixed bug #1370186: SQL Editor discards changes when session is closed
- Fixed bug #1385270: Dropping multiple selected tables produces exceptions
- Fixed bug #1256021: Refresh item on a table showing the row number does not update the row count
- Fixed bug #1230126: ClassCastException when editing table data for tables with short and long column
- Fixed bugs #1043604 and #1043599: Unlocalized decimal separator caused problems when data was pasted
                      for example to Open Office Calc. In the Global preferences the user is now able
                      to chose the Java default format for floating point values or the localized form.
- Fixed bug # 863673: cannot DROP TABLE
- Fixed bug # 887525: When Object Tree Nodes are the selected by keystrokes the selected node is scrolled
                      to visible.
- Fixed bug # 763347: Alias and Datasource loss on crash. Files are now written to a temp file first and
                      then renamed.

- Fixed bug: In Code Completion, the database-dependent keywords where missing
- Fixed bug: In code completion, columns weren't shown correctly when the same table alias name was used
             in different statements for different tables (Thanks to Abhishek Gupta)


2.1 final
=========

- Fixed bug #757354 Aliases not reordering on change: Introduced sort button in Alias window tool bar.
- Fixed bug #732696: Dump application success window title and Dump application file filter.
- SQuirreL is ready for internationalization. The new I18n plugin supports translations.
  Put the Plugin in your Plugin path, restart SQuirreL and open the Global Preferences dialog.
  There you'll find a new tab named I18n. Follow the instructions there.
- Fixed bug #1386916 (Informix 3.0 JC3 is considered "not JDBC 2.1 compliant) The
  algorithm for detecting non-compliance incorrectly concluded non-compliance if the
  database doesn't support save points.
- Oracle Plugin: Added access to SYS schema in the object tree for non-privileged
  users since this is where the user-oriented DDL information tables and views are located.
- Fixed bug #1377304: Ant-built distributions do not preserve file permissions
  (Thanks to Charles Albrecht)
- Fixed bug #1376981: SQL Scripts plugin fails to create table script for Axion DB.
- Fixed *ugly* bug in editing SQL results:
  To reproduce the bug you had to have two editable SQLs for different tables. Execute the first
  and edit some results. Close the result tab. Execute the second SQL. Editing of this
  result would fail. The reason was that SQuirreL reuses result tabs but did not properly initialize
  them before reuse. Because of this editing could feel terribly instable when some results had been closed
  and SQuirreL began to reuse tabs.
- Sizes of Properies and Preferences windows are restored.
- Made Syntax highlighting work for: Data Types, Functions, Operators, Identifiers, White Spaces
- Fixed bug #1276957: Oracle protocol violation.
- Oracle Plugin (v0.15) - If the user doesn't have the DBA privilege, then only loads the
  schemas in the object tree to which the user has been granted access.

2.1 rc2
=======

- Bug fix: If SQLs are saved to a file the Session window's title bar displayed an error message instead of
  the alias and file name.

- Bug fix: If two Sessions are open and one is closed the one left open lost key bindings
  which means that for example arrow navigation keys don't work anymore.


2.1 rc1
=======

- Selecting a code completion with tab (instead of enter) will delete the string between the carret position and the next white space.
- New Session properties to configure code completion for functions. Examples: {call myFun(<IN Integer myParam>} or plain myFun()

- Fixed memory leaks. The memory panel in the status bar now tells which Session are garbage collected.
  Use JDK 1.5.x for better memory behavior.

- Fixed several problems when reconnecting an open Session. (See menu Session --> reconnect)

- Improved Exception handling and new Log panel in Status bar:
  SQuirreL's: exception/log handling had two problems:
  i. Exceptions could easily occur without being logged.
  ii. It was hard for users to get aware of logs. The only way was to regularly open the logs window.

  It is taken care now that all exceptions are logged. The user is notified that a log was produced by the
  new Log panel in SQuirreL's status bar. A traffic lights color of the last log is displayed on one of the
  Log panel's buttons.  The last log color is displayed for 5 seconds and is then turned bag to white.
  This allows the user to have an eye an the logs without much disturbance.
  The buttons of the Log panel allow the user to view the last Log and to open the logs window.

- New Memory panel in Status bar.
- Cleaned up SQuirreL logs
- Made Swingset's Aqua Look and Feel available
- Fixed bug: No line counter label on SQL Worksheet (opened by ctrl+n)
- Fixed the following Exception on Sybase when the Object tab was used:
  java.sql.SQLException: "..."."dbo"."..." not found
  (Thanks to Gupta, Abhishek)
- Added "cut/copy SQL to be executed" function to the editor. Since SQuirreL knows the concept
  of SQL text without selection (from caret position between previous and next empty line),
  these functions are short hands for the usual copy and cut which only work on selected text.
- Fixed deleting rows from editable SQL result and from contents tab (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds)
- Fixed bug #1331445: Line comments could change SQLs.
- Patch #1326472 - Oracle plugin is smarter about accessing restricted tables as an unprivileged user
  (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Bug fix: Limited rows/SQL - hints on top of a result tab could be corrupted (for example multi lined) because of missing HTML escaping.
- Improved messaging for driver definition.
- Bug fix: Driver Icon did not update when driver was changed.
- Added IBM DB2 Net driver to default drivers.
- The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the MS SQLServer plugin.
- Patch #1324774 The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the
  Oracle Plugin (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Added Session Property "load columns in background". This option might help people who feel that the SQL editor
  hangs because they use databases with a lot of objects and/or use low data transfer rates.
- Configurable warning for JDBC API version mismatch between the JVM and JDBC driver
- Fixed bug #1316903 (SQL Panel hangs when Ctrl-B on whitespace)
- Added comment/uncomment functions to the SQL editor.
- Made auto corrections and duplicate line available outside the Netbeans editor.
- Bug fix: Code completion did not work when object was directly preceded by =,> or <. Example: Table1.col1=Tab...
- Enabled code completion when a ' or a " is on front of the name to complete (RFE 1305802)
- Fixed bug #1288519 (Postgres: editing boolean fields)
- Fixed for table and tree row height for large fonts. (Thanks to Mitch Skinner)
- User may define an Object tree filter through the Session Properties. Useful for large databases. (Thanks to Oliver Jehle)


2.0 final
=========
- Fix for not shown SQL result on derby DB
- Right Mouse Menu on SQL result tabs (Not working on JDK 1.4 with scrollable tabbed panes due to Bug #4465870.)
  Functions also available in tools popup
- Session property: Limit SQL result tabs.
  By default limiting is switched on and set to 15 tabs.
- Fixed Bug #1234642 (Missing query numbers in message panel)
- When executing a SQL batch (several SQL's separated by statement separator)
  in case of an error the errornous SQL is printed to the message panel.
- From within the SQL Editor one can jump to the Object at cursor in the Object tree.
  To do so use the ctrl+B shortcut or the right mouse menu or the tools popup (ctrl+T)
- New Session property: 'Write SQL Execution Errors to log file'.
  The execution errors of an SQL statement shown in the message panel
  may now also be written to the squirrel-sql.log file
- Fixed bug #1244287 (white space after statement)
- Fixed bug #1217765 (Editing table data for tables with BIT column type)
- Mnemonics for Main Tabbed Pain
- Fixes in editing SQL Results:
  Editing didn't work when a column was in the select list twice
  Editing didn't work when a column was when the statement was like 'SELECT * FROM MyTable ORDER BY MyID'
- Added new Global Preference to show the plugin files being loaded in Splash Screen on startup

========

Enhancements
------------
- Added "Reformat XML" popup menu option to show formatted XML in a column
  (Gerd Wagner).
- User may identify specific columns to use in WHERE clause when editing
  cells in table by using the "Limit cell edit WHERE clause size" entry in

  are automatically split across multiple pages both horizontally and
  vertically (Glenn Griffin).
- The "Session Properties"->"Format" screen has been moved to "Global
  Preferences"->"Data Type Controls", and many new controls have been added
  to adjust how specific data types are used or displayed. (Glenn Griffin)
  Examples:
	- Some DBs do not allow LONGVARCHAR to be used in the WHERE clause, so this
	  may now be disabled
	- Dates, Times and Timestamps may be displayed and entered in a
	  user-selected format
	- Strings containing newlines may display the newlines as "\n" or not show
	  them as selected by the user.


Bug Fixes
---------
- Close metadata result sets once they are no longer required.
- Fixed bug where inserting/updating and deleting rows in the SQL tab would
  loop (Gerd Wagner).
- Fixed bug where setting the statement separator to an empty string then
  wouldn't allow you to change it to anything else (Gerd Wagner).

1.2beta5
========

Enhancements
------------
- added the 'IS NULL' and 'IS NOT NULL' to the choices for operator in
  the Where Clause panel (Maury Hammel).
- When the 'add' button is pressed to put a Where Clause construct into
  the text area, the 'Value' text area is cleared (Maury Hammel).
- Enabled wrapping and added JScrollPanes to the Where Clause and Order
  By Clause text areas, so Panels behave better where large values are put
  in them (Maury Hammel).
- You can now specify whether JDBC logging uses the deprecated output stream or
  the new writer (Neville Rowe).
- You can now filter the catalogs displayed in the object tree (Keith
  Mashinter).
- You can now specify whether to load schemas/catalogs in the object tree
  (Keith Mashinter).
- You can now specify whether to load result set metadata when executing an SQL
  (Keith Mashinter).
- You can Import/Export cell data to/from files and operate on that data with
  external commands (e.g. VI, etc) (Glenn Griffin)
- BLOBs and CLOBs are now fully editable, as are all of the most common SQL
  types (Glenn Griffin).
- Data that can be edited only in the Popup (ie. not in the cell) is now shown
  with a Cyan background to tell the user that it can be edited, but only in
  the Popup (Glenn Griffin).
- Data containing newlines now shows the newlines explicitly in the in-cell
  view, i.e. as "\n" (Glenn Griffin).
- User may select specific columns to use in the WHERE clause when editing
  a specific table.

  Rowe).
- Fix manifest file so the the squirrel-sql.jar file is again executable (Denis
  Lundberg).
- Fix resource strings (Dennis Lundberg).
- Do a better job of handling MS SQL server catalog names that contain periods.
- Strings (VARCHAR and CLOB) fields containing newlines would loose those
  newlines if edited within the cell.  In-cell editing of that data is now
  blocked (Glenn Griffin).
- SQL problem with WHERE clause being too long (table has too many columns)
  fixed by allowing user to select specific columns to use in WHERE.

Other
-----
- New API ISession.addToToolbar(Action action) added (Gerd Wagner).
- Don't default to displaying the Contents Tab for a table. This can cause
  performance issues when looking at SQL Views (Gerd Wagner).


1.2beta4
========

Enhancements
------------
- Add "Get Last SQL" button to SQL entry area.
- Show tooltip in sql history combo when combo collapsed.
- You can now filter the schemas displayed in the object tree (Keith
  Mashinter).

  editable (Glenn Griffin).
- Data in individual cells may be imported, exported, or operated on by an
  external program from the Popup window (double-click on cell in ContentsTab)
  (Glenn Griffin).


Bug Fixes
--------
- Fixed NullPointerException thrown by the Syntax plugin.
- The title from the wrong column was used in the popup window for a columns
  data if the columns in the table had been resequenced (Joseph Boyd).
- Allow for SQLException thrown by HSQLDB 1.7.1 on ResultSetmetaData.isSigned.
- If the columns in a table were resequenced and then the data was copied to
  the clipboard then the column headings in the clipboard were in the wrong
  order (Joseph Boyd).
- Entries in the catalogs dropdown are now sorted.

Other
-----
- Move DataCache class to fw classes.
- Add StringManager class to allow strings to be stored in property
  files rather than hardcoded. Once this is used throughout the
  application it will mean that SQuirreL can be internationalized.
