SQuirreL SQL Client Change Log
==============================

Not yet released, available in CVS or probably in latest weekly build
=====================================================================

- Selecting a code completion with tab (instead of enter) will delete the string between the carret position and the next white space.  
- New Session properties to configure code completion for functions. Examples: {call myFun(<IN Integer myParam>} or plain myFun()

- Fixed memory leaks. The memory panel in the status bar now tells which Session are garbage collected.
  Use JDK 1.5.x for better memory behavior.

- Fixed several problems when reconnecting an open Session. (See menu Session --> reconnect)

- Improved Exception handling and new Log panel in Status bar:
  SQuirreL's: exception/log handling had two problems:
  i. Exceptions could easily occur without being logged.
  ii. It was hard for users to get aware of logs. The only way was to regularly open the logs window.

  It is taken care now that all exceptions are logged. The user is notified that a log was produced by the
  new Log panel in SQuirreL's status bar. A traffic lights color of the last log is displayed on one of the
  Log panel's buttons.  The last log color is displayed for 5 seconds and is then turned bag to white.
  This allows the user to have an eye an the logs without much disturbance.
  The buttons of the Log panel allow the user to view the last Log and to open the logs window.

- New Memory panel in Status bar.
- Cleaned up SQuirreL logs
- Made Swingset's Aqua Look and Feel available
- Fixed bug: No line counter label on SQL Worksheet (opened by ctrl+n)
- Fixed the following Exception on Sybase when the Object tab was used:
  java.sql.SQLException: "..."."dbo"."..." not found 
  (Thanks to Gupta, Abhishek)
- Added "cut/copy SQL to be executed" function to the editor. Since SQuirreL knows the concept
  of SQL text without selection (from caret position between previous and next empty line),
  these functions are short hands for the usual copy and cut which only work on selected text.
- Fixed deleting rows from editable SQL result and from contents tab (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds) 
- Fixed bug #1331445: Line comments could change SQLs.
- Patch #1326472 - Oracle plugin is smarter about accessing restricted tables as an unprivileged user
  (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Bug fix: Limited rows/SQL - hints on top of a result tab could be corrupted (for example multi lined) because of missing HTML escaping.
- Improved messaging for driver definition.
- Bug fix: Driver Icon did not update when driver was changed.
- Added IBM DB2 Net driver to default drivers.
- The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the MS SQLServer plugin.
- Patch #1324774 The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the
  Oracle Plugin (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Added Session Property "load columns in background". This option might help people who feel that the SQL editor
  hangs because they use databases with a lot of objects and/or use low data transfer rates.
- Configurable warning for JDBC API version mismatch between the JVM and JDBC driver
- Fixed bug #1316903 (SQL Panel hangs when Ctrl-B on whitespace)
- Added comment/uncomment functions to the SQL editor.
- Made auto corrections and duplicate line available outside the Netbeans editor.
- Bug fix: Code completion did not work when object was directly preceded by =,> or <. Example: Table1.col1=Tab...
- Enabled code completion when a ' or a " is on front of the name to complete (RFE 1305802)
- Fixed bug #1288519 (Postgres: editing boolean fields)
- Fixed for table and tree row height for large fonts. (Thanks to Mitch Skinner)
- User may define an Object tree filter through the Session Properties. Useful for large databases. (Thanks to Oliver Jehle)


2.0 final
=========
- Fix for not shown SQL result on derby DB
- Right Mouse Menu on SQL result tabs (Not working on JDK 1.4 with scrollable tabbed panes due to Bug #4465870.)
  Functions also available in tools popup
- Session property: Limit SQL result tabs.
  By default limiting is switched on and set to 15 tabs.
- Fixed Bug #1234642 (Missing query numbers in message panel)
- When executing a SQL batch (several SQL's separated by statement separator)
  in case of an error the errornous SQL is printed to the message panel.
- From within the SQL Editor one can jump to the Object at cursor in the Object tree.
  To do so use the ctrl+B shortcut or the right mouse menu or the tools popup (ctrl+T)
- New Session property: 'Write SQL Execution Errors to log file'.
  The execution errors of an SQL statement shown in the message panel
  may now also be written to the squirrel-sql.log file
- Fixed bug #1244287 (white space after statement)
- Fixed bug #1217765 (Editing table data for tables with BIT column type)
- Mnemonics for Main Tabbed Pain
- Fixes in editing SQL Results:
  Editing didn't work when a column was in the select list twice
  Editing didn't work when a column was when the statement was like 'SELECT * FROM MyTable ORDER BY MyID'
- Added new Global Preference to show the plugin files being loaded in Splash Screen on startup
