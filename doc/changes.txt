SQuirreL SQL Client Change Log
==============================

Not yet released - available from CVS or in the latest snapshot:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Enhancements:

- 'Delete Records' action now orders the selected tables in order to satisfy any
  FK dependencies.  Previously, this operation would fail if PK tables preceded
  (by name alphabetically) FK tables in the object tree list.

- Certain plugins (Oracle, Sybase, MS SQL-Server) now have configuration tabs 
  (in Global Preferences) to allow for configuration of the statement separator 
  for scripts independently from the Session properties configuration.  For 
  example, this means that now when you switch between session windows that use 
  different statement separators (Oracle = ';' / Sybase = 'GO'), you no longer 
  have to change the global statement separator for all sessions to get the 
  correct one for script execution. As long as you have the plugin installed 
  which corresponds to the type of database that a session is accessing, a 
  reasonable default is supplied to make this configuration unnecessary in most 
  cases.

- Added better support for executing large scripts (by default, a script is 
  considered large if it has > 200 SQL statements selected for execution in the
  script).  Now, only one message is written in the message panel at the bottom
  of the session window at the end of running many statements summarizing the 
  details of execution (timing, statement type and count, etc).  The message
  "SQL Statement x of y <some sql...>" is still displayed in the results panel to 
  indicate progress. Also, the history bar isn't updated during large script 
  execution. The "200 SQL statement" default is configurable in Global 
  Preferences under 'SQL' tab and all of this new functionality can be disabled 
  by using '0' (zero) as the value of large script statement count.  This 
  dramatically improves UI responsiveness for large scripts (especially those 
  with statement counts in the thousands) and makes it possible to cancel the 
  execution using the cancel button - which is otherwise effectively disabled 
  while the UI attempts to keep up with all of the UI updates in a large script.

Code Completion:
   The number of table columns that should be displayed on top of the completion list
   when completion is called outside of the scope of a table/view is now configurable
   in code completion properties.

New Plugins for H2, PostgreSQL and DB2
	These plugins provide source tabs for stored procedures, views and triggers.
	They also provide details tab for sequences and triggers	

New Plugin for Sybase ASE by Ken McCullough
  	The plugin allows to script the code of Views and Stored Procedures of the 
  	Sybase ASE DB.

SQL Scripts Plugin
  - Now when selecting 'Create Data Script', the insert statements created are
    ordered by the first column.

Oracle Plugin
  - Added configuration panel for Oracle plugin in Global Preferences to allow 
    configuration of new custom Oracle query tokenizer.
  - Added support for executing create procedure and create function blocks 
    delimited by a single "/" such as is supported in SQL-Plus.  Also, added 
    support for the "@" construct which is used to specify a script file to be 
    included.
  - Source tab for views now presents source code that is formatted and 
    correctly formed to allow it to be used as an SQL statement to replicate 
    the view.
  - Added the schema name to the SID for session nodes - it's easier now to 
    find the session you are looking for.

Informix Plugin
  - Is now using the code reformatter for formatting the Source Tab for views 
    The code reformatter was written by Gerd Wagner and previoously located in 
    the EditExtras plugin.  It has been moved to core so that other plugins can 
    take advantage of this capability.

DBCopy Plugin 
  - Analyzes FKs to be copied and skips them if they already exist in 
    destination database. 
  - Now the plugin reorders source tables to satisfy FK dependencies when 
    copying data into existing tables with similar constraints.
  - The error message for SQLExceptions now includes the SQL statement that was 
    last executed (including bind variable values if it was a PreparedStatement)


Bug-Fixes:

Caching of schemas (serializing to disc) failed. A NotSerializableException was thrown.


An error occured when F5 (Refresh) was hit in a SQL Work Sheet or an Object Tree Window.

Updated Simplified Chinese translation strings (Thanks to xpdz)
Updated French translation strings (Thanks to Erwan Duroselle)
Updated Italian translation strings (Thanks to Ivo Neri)

1659412 TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE shows as <Unknown (-101)> - Support was added
        for rendering values of columns with this Oracle-specific type.

1617839 Two new lines with white spaces in between do not separate SQLs when 
        SQLs are executed without selection.

1639680 Cannot export smallint and decimal to MS Excel

1635259 Session menu has two items with mnemonic "T"

1639662 Block comments can be ended prematurely
        (Thanks to Sam Polak for the patch)

1631392 (Dropping materialized views) - The 'Drop' menu item has been replaced
        by a 'Drop Table(s)' menu item available with the Refactoring Plugin.  
        The new menu item allows the user to specify whether or not to cascade 
        constraints as well as being able to see the SQL that will be executed.

DBCopy Plugin 
  - If the source/dest database is Oracle, and the type of column being copied 
    is DATE, then treat it like a TIMESTAMP for reading or writing the value.  
    Oracle stores a time component in date columns and this prevents this 
    time component value from being lost if the destination database can also 
    store a time component in DATE columns.

Derby Plugin  
  - Transformed trigger source tab contents into valid SQL that can be used 
    to re-create the trigger.  
  - Fixed multiple bugs that occurred in the source tab when the same 
    view/trigger name is used in multiple schemas.

Informix Plugin 
  - Fixed to work with IDS 9 - qualified references to all system views by 
    prefixing them with the string 'informix.' (no quotes).
  - Fixed ordering segements within the body of Stored Procedures.  
  - Applied code formatting to triggers and view source.  
  - Fixed erroneous inclusion of extra whitespace which for some definitions 
    made the SQL invalid.

Refactoring Plugin 
  - Now allows precision and scale for new or modified columns to be set to 0.
  - The scrollbar in the column list dialog now appears, where previously it 
    did not, making tables with many columns difficult to work with for 
    Add/Modify/Drop column. 


2.4 (12/31/2006)
================

    New Features/Enhancements:

Note: This is the first release of SQuirreL that specifically requires JDK 1.5 
or higher to compile and run. The build scripts and the installer now check for 
at least 1.5 before proceeding.

MS Excel export of displayed tables:
  Besides the exporting tables displayed in SQuirreL to CSV files it is now 
  possible to export to MS Excel files. Thanks to Andrï¿½ Schild for the patch.

Graph Plugin: New right mouse menu item for tables: "View table in Object tree"

Derby Plugin: A new plugin which allows the user to view source for triggers and
views.  Also, detailed information about triggers is available.

Informix Plugin: A new plugin which allows the user to view source for stored 
procedure, trigger and view objects. Also provides Informix-specific details 
for indexes and triggers.  Special thanks goes to Doug Lawry for help setting 
up an Informix instance for developing the plugin, and providing the system 
catalog queries necessary for the object information provided by this plugin.

Refactoring Plugin: A new plugin which currently allows users to alter
tables by adding, modifying and dropping columns as well as adding/dropping 
Primary Keys.  Uses an extended Hibernate dialect framework to derive SQL which 
is syntactically correct for the database being modified.

Made SQuirreL work with hxtt drivers. See www.hxtt.com. Thanks to Yonghong Zhao 
for patches.

Oracle Plugin:
   Windows for
    - DB Output, 
    - Session Info,
    - SGA Trace,
    - Invalid Objects
   were changed in the following ways:
   - Tool bar buttons are not in the main frame tool bar any more but in the 
     Session tool bar.
   - Each window has its own tool bar icon.
   - All windows restore their last size and position.
   - All windows provide a "Stay on top" check box.

Syntax plugin: Corrections/Abreviations allow new lines. Use \n to create a 
new line. Note: Bookmarks are more powerful than abreviations.

SQuirreL paths (-home, -user) are shown in Global Preferences

LAF Plugin: Added Napkin Look and Feel (JDK 1.5 only)

Completion Popup (Code Completion ctrl+space, Tools Popup ctrl+t, 
Bookmarks Popup ctrl+j): When the beginning/end of the pop up list is reached 
another arrow up/down jumps to the last/first entry. 

1015274: Provided better DB2/400 system naming support

1602255: 'Interpret DATE columns as TIMESTAMP' also in SQL view.  When this 
configuration item is checked, any SQL query result that contains a DATE column
will show the DATE values as TIMESTAMP values (This is useful with Oracle where
DATE columns also contain TIME components)

Schema refresh on catalog combo box change:
Schemas are refreshed automatically, when the user switches to another catalog.
On systems that support Catalogs like Sybase or MSSQL, Schemas within a Catalog 
only become accessible when the catalog combo box is switched to the their 
Catalog. To make Schemas available in the Object Tree, Code completion etc. 
after a Catalog switch Schemas are now automatically refreshed.
(Thanks to Stan Berka for this patch)

Graph Plugin:
The Graph plugin now allows to save jpg images to files instead of printing them.
The image files are an exact copy of what would be sent to a printer and
can easily be used within other applications.
(Feature requested by David Karr)

DBCopy Plugin: Added support for Informix and HADB.  Relocated dialect framework
to core to allow other plugins to use (Refactoring) - this version is now no 
longer compatible or supported for previous versions of SQuirreL.

Re-organized the table and view context menus so that the SQLScripts 
plugin menu items now appear under the "Scripts" menu item and in the
same order that they appear in the session menu "Scripts" menu item.

Updated Spanish translation strings (Thanks to Diego Schulz)

Added JDBC driver CLASSNAME and CLASSPATH to the Metadata tab so that
it is not necessary to open the driver definition for the current session to 
get this information.

	Bug-Fixes:

When reconnecting a Session with the current connection dead
SQuirreL always switched to Autocommit = false state. Now the Sessions
Autocommit state is preserved.


MySQL Plugin: Fixed bug which caused the MySQL all of the tabs to appear with no
content.

SQL editor function "View Object at cursor in Object tree" (ctrl+B) now works
for fully qualified object names with leading and trailing quotation marks and 
slashes.

Oracle plugin: Fixed the rendering of details/source tabs for indexes
sequences and triggers.

Added support for Informix way of referring to database objects within 
catalog and schema as catalog:"schema".objectname.

DBCopy plugin:
  - Removed reflective code used for backward compatibility which was causing 
  IllegalAccessExceptions when the keyword test was applied to column names.

  - Fixed bug in copying FK constraints which left cursors open by not properly 
  closing ResultSets when they were no longer needed.

  - Fixed bug in copying FK constraints where the primary key table 
  name wasn't fully qualified the schema of the destination database.  This was 
  most noticeable when copying tables with FKs into a schema which was not the 
  default schema for that session.

  - Fixed bug where cancelling the copy operation during table data transfer 
    did not also cancel the transfer of table constraints.

1601610 - Bug while editing integer/long columns
  
1598162: Fixed the issue when using Java 6 you had to click the Connect button 
twice when the app is first started.

1597463: Maximized and multimonitor window size not saved

1595913: Cannot select SQL dropdown under java 6.

Added logic to prevent the MacOS X plugin from loading if not on the mac 
platform.  It causes the Global Preferences menu item to disappear when it is 
loaded and the platform isn't Mac

Look and Feel Plugin: Plastic Look and Feels (JGoodies) weren't available anymore.

"Make Editable" on single table SQL did not work when SELECT list contained new lines.

1554175: (Aliases lost on close) 
1532997: (NullPointerException when trying to save alias)
1522229: (Error occured saving Alias Definitions java.lang.NullPointer)
Many people complained about this one.  At first we determined this was low 
priority since it didn't seem to be reproducable on all jvms. We inadvertantly 
changed the SQLDriverPropertyCollectionBeanInfo such that it no longer 
accurately described the bean SQLDriverPropertyCollection.  in 1.4.2_05 this 
triggered an NPE bug in the jvm code (Introspector.addPropertyDescriptor) which 
caused the SQLAlias persistence to fail, leaving the user with no aliases.

1584283: (DBCopy plugin - Copying LOBs from Oracle to Oracle fails)
If destination column type is Types.OTHER (1111), try to get 
the type name and map it to a valid java SQL type (such as 
Types.BLOB or Types.CLOB).  This only works when the database column
type name as reported by the JDBC driver is a standard type such as 
BLOB, VARCHAR, CLOB, CHAR, etc... A mapping exception is thrown 
otherwise.

1584260: (DBCopy plugin - Fix for issue where the same table is found in 
multiple schemas/catalogs that the user has access to.  Now we specify catalog 
or schema if the driver claims to support them.)

1577254: Trigger details tabs aren't rendered

1532857: (DB2 on AS400 table list not shown) Incorporated Colin Bell's patch 
to address this issue which causes SQuirreL to give '*ALLUSR' for the schema
value when calling DatabaseMetaData.getTables.

1520156: changed the function of the configurable ref actions checkboxes for 
SQLScript plugin.  Now, they will override what is contained in the 
DatabaseMetaData if checked.  If not checked, we now use whatever the database 
tells us the ref action is (before we weren't bothering to check the with 
the database.  Now we do, by default)

1508503: (Double entry for each column fields): Don't add the column to the 
list if it is already there - uses the fully qualified version of the column, 
so may still see duplicate columns with different types.

Bug Fix: Editing data in multiple tables would sometimes fail erroneously with
an error message like "This row in the Database has changed since you 
refreshed the data. No rows will be updated by this operation".

Bug Fix: Solved issue where tables were not appearing in the object tree for
Sun HADB (High-Availability Database).  Special thanks to Lars Heill of Sun
Microsystems, Inc. for technical assistance with installing/configuring HADB.

2.3 Final
=========

Enhancements:

An Italian translation of SQuirreL labels/messages is now available in the 
installer (Thanks to Ivo Neri)

Bug Fixes:

1563613: Alias property window dies when URL is malformed.

1563610: (Only connection specified DB schema loaded regardless)
         Enhanced the catalog selection so that changing the catalog 
		 updates the schema info and expands the TABLES node in the tree
		 for the selected catalog.

1563603: ORA-01830 error: Date format

1561293: Show Loaded Drivers Only" does not work in "Add Alias" dialog.

1558509: 'create sequence' rejected as invalid SQL

1520156: (Reverse Engineering Foreign Key Cascade Missing).  Added 
		 configuration for referential actions clause of FK constraints.

1426012: PLAN_TABLE not found - look for PLAN_TABLE in other schemas and allow
         user to choose one.

1371587: Not possible to edit data after SQL query
         
1250855: (Oracle DATE does not display correctly) Added a new configuration
         item to Global Preferences -> Date Type Controls -> Date Section
		 which allows the user to "Interpret DATE columns as TIMESTAMP".

Bug Fix: Fix for issue where the SGA Trace view wasn't displaying data in the 
	     "Buffer Gets per Row" column.

2.3 rc2
=========

    New Features/Enhancements:

Feature Request #1556226: New menu items in the right mouse menu of tables -
   "Adopt all column widths" - Adopts all columns widths of current table to 
                               header/data.
   "Always adopt all column widths" (check box) - Widths are automatically 
                                                  adopted for all tables opened 
                                                  in the future.

New menu-item "Export CSV" in context menu of table contents spreadsheet allows 
the user to choose whether to use formatting from Global Prefs or default 
formatting.

SQL result tabs offer to rerun their SQL query to update their data.

Text limit line of Netbeans editor can now be positioned or switched off in 
Session Properties.

    Bug Fixes:

1448738: (JDK 6.0 regression) This appeared to be a bug in the Java 6 SE, but it
         turned out that we weren't using the correct method to load classes from
         the ClassLoader.  Sun "fixed" the method (ClassLoader.loadClass) that 
         we were using previously so that it no longer worked as it did in 1.4 
         and 1.5.  For details see:
         http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6446627
         We rectified the problem in SQuirreL by following Sun's suggestions 
         regarding which API methods are being called.

1544447: (Generated SQL script Table names are not fully Qualified, it should
		 be "SCHEMA"."TABLE_NAME")  Added a new global preference panel and 
		 checkbox to make this alternative behavior configurable.  The default
		 now is to qualify table names with their schema name.

1541154: (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in DataTypeDouble)

1533824: (NPE when loading keywords from DatabaseMetaData) Check the values
         returned for null before attempting to parse and store them 
         (DB2 driver returns null for getCatalogTerm())

Bug fix: When doing a complete refresh (F5) or a refresh item in the Object tree 
         (see right mouse menu) code completion was not refreshed. 

Bug fix: In Oracle Plugin - Avoided open cursors when viewing database output 
						    ( dbms_output.put_line() ).

Bug fix: Stored procedures where not shown in Object Tree when the 
         Oracle Plugin was used.

Bug fix: When a Schema was created and the Object Tree was refreshed the new 
         Schema was not shown. 

Bug fix: In Alias properties for Oracle - 
  Note: This bug took effect when default Alias properties were used.
        So this fix probably increases Session startup performance for Oracle 
        users who use the Oracle plugin but do not care for Alias properties.
  Bug: When an Alias was configured to load all Schemas and cache non
       but the Oracle Alias properties didn't allow to load all schemas
       SQuirreL still did load all tables and procedures from the database.
       Though the unallowed tables and procedures did not show up in the Object 
       tree they still caused bad startup perfomance.
  Fix: Now only tables and procedures for allowed schemas are loaded.

Bug fix: Object tree table tab titles were not being internationalized as 
         their values were hard-coded and not available in 
         I18NStrings.properties files.  Now they are.

    Installer Changes:

Three new translations were added to the installer:
	Simplified Chinese (Thanks to xpdz)
	French (Thanks to Erwan Duroselle)
	German (Thanks to Andreas Oswald)

Added new optional plugin (DBCopy) to the installer which allows database tables
and their content to be copied from one session to another inside of SQuirreL
using Copy/Paste menu items.


2.3 rc1
=========


If an Alias is configured to Auto Logon but has wrong user name/password
  on connecting the user gets an error dialog and has to correct user name/password.
  For convenience the corrected data now is written back to the Alias.
  Note: The Writing back is only done when the Alias is configured to Auto Logon.  


Session startup performance
  General: New Alias properties allow to configure loading and caching of Schemas.
  Oracle: When the Oracle Plugin ist used an Oracle tab in Alias properties enables you
          to allow an Alias's Sessions only to see Schemas the user has access to.


Fixed bug #1504123: Oracle hints losts
  By default SQuirreL treads /*...*/ as comments and removes them before sending a SQL to a database.
  This default may now be changed in the (New) Session Properties. See Menu File --> New Session Properties --> Tab SQL.


Added toolbar button to toggle auto commit

Bug fixes in Oracle Plugin:
  - Explain Plan not visible in Results tab
  - Object tree: Sessions, Users and Instances and nodes sometimes not visible
  - Object tree: SYS Schema displayed twice for certain user rights
  - Fixed Memory Leak (Session were not garbage collected when Oracle Plugin was used)


Fixed bug #984527: Right mouse popup menu is now available in empty table. 

Feature request #1446675 Output tables to CSV files
  All tables' right mouse menus have an 'Export CVS ...' item.
  In the export dialog you may provide an application (like OpenOffice calc or MS Excel)
  to open the CSV file immediately after creation.

New toolbar button: Select current SQL (control Shift S)
 This function is based on SQuirreL's concept of 'current SQL': If there is no selected text the current SQL
 is the text between the empty line in fornt of cursor position and the empty line after cursor position.
 Any function that deals with SQL is aware of this concept.

Installer now includes the following optional translation packages:
- Brazilian Portuguese (contributed by Francis Martin)
- Czech (contributed by Jan Kostrhun)
- Bulgarian (contributed by Ivan Dimov)

Feature request #1441787 Quickly adopt column widths to column values
  when table header is double clicked while the resize mouse pointer (<-->) is visible. (MS Excel like)  

Enhancements of the Bookmarks Plugin
 - Bookmark preferences can be opened by the "Edit Bookmarks" button in the Session toolbar.
 - Bookmarks can be run from within the Bookmark Preferences.
 - Lots of "SQuirreL Bookmarks" which are templates for many common SQL/DDL statements.
 - User can decide if he wants to see "SQuirreL Bookmarks" in the Bookmarks selection popup of the SQL Editor (ctrl j).

Fixed bugs in error and syntax highlighting:
 - Error highlighting for "ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT ..."
 - Error highlighting for "CREATE VIEW ..."
 - Error and syntax highlighting for "CASE [...] WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE .. END"


Centralized Database Meta Data caching. This brings along the following improvements:
- When a DDL statement is run the Object Tree is updated immediately to reflect the change.
  This works as long as standard DDL statements are used.
- Syntax coloring and code completion for newly created tables, views, columns, procedures is available
  right after a DDL statement was run. This works as long as standard DDL statements are used.
- The Refresh button updates the Object tree as well as syntax highlighting and code completion.


Make the status message for rows affected by executing an SQL statement in the SQL panel
take into account the type of SQL query issued.

Fixed Bug #1472398: Content tab filters didn't work with views.


Fixed Bug #1465707: Programm slow with big Databases because reading Database Meta Data twice.
                    Technical detail: The SchemaInfo class has become SQuirreL's central meta data cache. 

Fixed Bug: SQuirreL crashed during building output of SQL results when errors occured in number-type or date-type fields.

Fixed Bug in Graph Plugin: In zoomed graphs lines with folding points could not be selected.


2.2 Final
=========


- Fixed Bug #1467671: Session Properties / General / Appearance: "SQL Results Tabs" overwrites
                     "SQL Execution Tabs" setting.

- Fixed Bug #1464361: Windows bat file is location specific (Thanks to Bill Wallace)

- Fixed Bug #1456423: Cannot cancel a query. Changed to allow the cancel operation to interrupt the
                     fetching of results.  While resolving the "hanging" of a long-running this also
                     allows results that have been fetched so far to be displayed.
                     This can help the user determine why the query was taking a long time to execute.
- Fixed Bug #1447231: ESCAPE key should close dialogs

- Fixed Bug #1457811: Autocomplete does not work for views when tables and view names match.

- Fixed Bug for Teradata not showing SQL results. (Thanks to Matthew Dahlman)

- Fixed Bug #1456463: update to allow the user to override the closing of a session in the event that
                    there are unsaved edits and they decide not to save them right away.  They can
                    always choose to not save and discard, closing the session immediately. This
                    change will make it so that if they choose to not discard, and something happens
                    during the save that causes the edits not to get saved, the session will not be
                    closed.  Added independently configurable options to warn when closing a session
                    if there are any unsaved edits (optional for File or Buffer).  If the
                    "Confirm Session Close" option is turned off, these can still be enabled so that
                    unsaved edits are never lost merely by closing a session.  Previously it was very
                    easy to lose changes made in the SQL edit tab when the session was closed.  This
                    previous behavior, if desired, is still available via Global Preferences.

- Fixed Bug #1441169: error in removing a deleted row more than once.

- Fixed Bug #1250514: Mysql Error: Cannot edit table.

2.2 RC1
=======

- There is now a printer icon in each SQL entry panel which will allow 
  the current sql script to be send to a printer.  Syntax highlighting
  is preserved.  SQL entry panel size is used to scale the font.

- Feature request #1441563 Query script generation:
  New entry for tables and views in the Objects tree's right mouse menu to create SELECT statements.  

- Added menu item and supporting capability to the SQLScripts plugin to 
  create a drop table script from the selected tables in the object tree.

- Added new property for drivers - website url - and a new menu item for 
  drivers to launch the system default web browser and load the driver 
  website url.

- When adding a new driver definition, SQuirreL will now look at the default 
  driver list and determine if any driver defs are missing from the user's
  personal list.  If so, SQuirreL will prompt the user to add them.

- MSSQL plugin: Scripting of procedures now works on MSSQL 2005

- Improved performance of the Session window when connecting to a database
  over a slow link (especially Oracle).  Instead of freezing the window, now
  SQuirreL indicates the progress of the session connection in the session
  frame status bar and allows the user to perform other tasks in parallel.
  Note: The session frame close button is temporarily ignored when the session
        is still loading and therefore not in a safe state to be closed. Once
        the session has been loaded, the close button will be re-enabled.

- Keyboard short cuts are shown in tool bar tool tips.

- Navigation through SQLs in SQL Editor by tool bar or Alt up/down keys.
  Note: The concept of an SQL in SQuirreL is the text between two empty lines. Many 
        functions in SQuirreL use this concept.  This way the user often doesn't 
        need to mark the text he wants to execute a function on.
        The concept is especially convenient for the Run SQL function (control Enter).

- Introduced Oracle specific code to allow editing of tables in Oracle that contain Date columns.
  Oracle stores time information in java.sql.Types.DATE columns. The where clauses that SQuirreL
  used to create to update data after editing only contained the Date part of those columns. That's why
  the where clause didn't match the database row and editing failed.

- SQL Editor: ctrl+backspace deletes word behind cursor.

- SQL Editor: To upper/lower case function available in tools pop up or by short cut ctrl+shift+u/l

- Row numbers in SQL result and Object Tree tables tables:
  Use the right mouse menu in SQL result tables or Object Tree tables to switch on row numbering.

- Improved handling of detached result windows:
  * By default result windows stay on top. A check box in the result window allows to change the default.
  * Result windows show up in the window list of the Windows menu and can be navigated to by Alt+left/right arrow.

- Added New, Close and Append icons/actions to allow the SQL Panel to function more

2.1 final
=========

- Fixed bug #757354 Aliases not reordering on change: Introduced sort button in Alias window tool bar.
- Fixed bug #732696: Dump application success window title and Dump application file filter.
- SQuirreL is ready for internationalization. The new I18n plugin supports translations.
  Put the Plugin in your Plugin path, restart SQuirreL and open the Global Preferences dialog.
  There you'll find a new tab named I18n. Follow the instructions there.
- Fixed bug #1386916 (Informix 3.0 JC3 is considered "not JDBC 2.1 compliant) The
  algorithm for detecting non-compliance incorrectly concluded non-compliance if the
  database doesn't support save points.
- Oracle Plugin: Added access to SYS schema in the object tree for non-privileged
  users since this is where the user-oriented DDL information tables and views are located.
- Fixed bug #1377304: Ant-built distributions do not preserve file permissions
  (Thanks to Charles Albrecht)
- Fixed bug #1376981: SQL Scripts plugin fails to create table script for Axion DB.
- Fixed *ugly* bug in editing SQL results:
  To reproduce the bug you had to have two editable SQLs for different tables. Execute the first
  and edit some results. Close the result tab. Execute the second SQL. Editing of this
  result would fail. The reason was that SQuirreL reuses result tabs but did not properly initialize
  them before reuse. Because of this editing could feel terribly instable when some results had been closed
  and SQuirreL began to reuse tabs.
- Sizes of Properies and Preferences windows are restored.
- Made Syntax highlighting work for: Data Types, Functions, Operators, Identifiers, White Spaces
- Fixed bug #1276957: Oracle protocol violation.
- Oracle Plugin (v0.15) - If the user doesn't have the DBA privilege, then only loads the
  schemas in the object tree to which the user has been granted access.

2.1 rc2
=======

- Bug fix: If SQLs are saved to a file the Session window's title bar displayed an error message instead of
  the alias and file name.

- Bug fix: If two Sessions are open and one is closed the one left open lost key bindings
  which means that for example arrow navigation keys don't work anymore.


2.1 rc1
=======

- Selecting a code completion with tab (instead of enter) will delete the string between the carret position and the next white space.
- New Session properties to configure code completion for functions. Examples: {call myFun(<IN Integer myParam>} or plain myFun()

- Fixed memory leaks. The memory panel in the status bar now tells which Session are garbage collected.
  Use JDK 1.5.x for better memory behavior.

- Fixed several problems when reconnecting an open Session. (See menu Session --> reconnect)

- Improved Exception handling and new Log panel in Status bar:
  SQuirreL's: exception/log handling had two problems:
  i. Exceptions could easily occur without being logged.
  ii. It was hard for users to get aware of logs. The only way was to regularly open the logs window.

  It is taken care now that all exceptions are logged. The user is notified that a log was produced by the
  new Log panel in SQuirreL's status bar. A traffic lights color of the last log is displayed on one of the
  Log panel's buttons.  The last log color is displayed for 5 seconds and is then turned bag to white.
  This allows the user to have an eye an the logs without much disturbance.
  The buttons of the Log panel allow the user to view the last Log and to open the logs window.

- New Memory panel in Status bar.
- Cleaned up SQuirreL logs
- Made Swingset's Aqua Look and Feel available
- Fixed bug: No line counter label on SQL Worksheet (opened by ctrl+n)
- Fixed the following Exception on Sybase when the Object tab was used:
  java.sql.SQLException: "..."."dbo"."..." not found
  (Thanks to Gupta, Abhishek)
- Added "cut/copy SQL to be executed" function to the editor. Since SQuirreL knows the concept
  of SQL text without selection (from caret position between previous and next empty line),
  these functions are short hands for the usual copy and cut which only work on selected text.
- Fixed deleting rows from editable SQL result and from contents tab (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds)
- Fixed bug #1331445: Line comments could change SQLs.
- Patch #1326472 - Oracle plugin is smarter about accessing restricted tables as an unprivileged user
  (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Bug fix: Limited rows/SQL - hints on top of a result tab could be corrupted (for example multi lined) because of missing HTML escaping.
- Improved messaging for driver definition.
- Bug fix: Driver Icon did not update when driver was changed.
- Added IBM DB2 Net driver to default drivers.
- The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the MS SQLServer plugin.
- Patch #1324774 The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the
  Oracle Plugin (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Added Session Property "load columns in background". This option might help people who feel that the SQL editor
  hangs because they use databases with a lot of objects and/or use low data transfer rates.
- Configurable warning for JDBC API version mismatch between the JVM and JDBC driver
- Fixed bug #1316903 (SQL Panel hangs when Ctrl-B on whitespace)
- Added comment/uncomment functions to the SQL editor.
- Made auto corrections and duplicate line available outside the Netbeans editor.
- Bug fix: Code completion did not work when object was directly preceded by =,> or <. Example: Table1.col1=Tab...
- Enabled code completion when a ' or a " is on front of the name to complete (RFE 1305802)
- Fixed bug #1288519 (Postgres: editing boolean fields)

  By default limiting is switched on and set to 15 tabs.
- Fixed Bug #1234642 (Missing query numbers in message panel)
- When executing a SQL batch (several SQL's separated by statement separator)
  in case of an error the errornous SQL is printed to the message panel.
- From within the SQL Editor one can jump to the Object at cursor in the Object tree.
  To do so use the ctrl+B shortcut or the right mouse menu or the tools popup (ctrl+T)
- New Session property: 'Write SQL Execution Errors to log file'.
  The execution errors of an SQL statement shown in the message panel
  may now also be written to the squirrel-sql.log file
- Fixed bug #1244287 (white space after statement)
- Fixed bug #1217765 (Editing table data for tables with BIT column type)
- Mnemonics for Main Tabbed Pain
