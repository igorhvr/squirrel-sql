 * This is the object that is actually stored in the ContentsTab table
 * for a BLOB field.
 * The data in a BLOB is handled differently than other data types.
 * When the row in the DB is read, what is returned is actually a
 * java.sql.Blob object that points to the data rather than the data itself.
 * Since BLOBs can be very large (and thus take a long time to read), we
 * provide the user the flexibility to read only part of the BLOB data, or
 * to not read any of it.  We use the user selected options in various operations
 * such as deciding if the field is editable or not.
 * These options are set in the Session Parameters,
 * and since those parameters can be changed after the data has been read, we
 * make a copy of the appropriate information here.
