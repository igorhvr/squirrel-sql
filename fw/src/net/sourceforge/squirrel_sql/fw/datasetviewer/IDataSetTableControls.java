 * Controls on how the JTable and concrete AbstractTableModel work
 * for a particular instance.
 * When we create the JTable and its associated (concrete) AbstractTableModel
 * objects, we do so within wrapper functions that define how the various
 * features of those objects operate.  This is currently done in MyJTable and
 * MyTable within DataSetViewerTablePanel.  However, since some of the tables
 * are read-only and others are editable, there are some aspects of the table
 * operation that must be defined by the caller/creator of the table rather than
 * within the MyJTable and MyTable wrapper functions.  This means that the
 * wrapper functions must be able to make a callback to the creator object
 * so that the creator handle those operations.  We put the actual work into the
 * creator/caller object rather than MyJTable and MyTable.
