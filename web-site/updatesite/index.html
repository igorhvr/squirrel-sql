<h2>SQuirreL SQL Client Update Site</h2>
<br>

This is a site that provides updated versions of SQuirreL SQL Client software artifacts. <br>  
SQuirreL has a feature that allows the user to update to the latest version that is available, <br> 
without having to re-install.  This site exists solely to service that feature. <br>
<p>
If you were not looking for updates to existing installations of SQuirreL, then perhaps you <br>
intended to go to the  <a href="http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/">project website</a>, 
which is hosted on SourceForge.net
