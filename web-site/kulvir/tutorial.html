      <BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This article describes 
        an open source application called SQuirreL SQL Client that provides an 
        easy-to-use interface to DB2 UDB as well as a number of other vendor databases 
        like Oracle and SQL Server. If your job requires you to interface with 
        many different databases in the course of a day, this may be the tool 
        for you. </font></BLOCKQUOTE>

        On my consulting engagements, I typically find myself interacting with 
        way more databases then I'd prefer... IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, 
        Sybase, to name just a few. Each of these databases has its own database 
        client tools which are all different. Wouldn't it be nice to have a single, 
        simple front end application that you can use to interact with the myriad 
        of database flavors you have to have your taste of throughout the day? 
        Life would even be sweeter if such an application were free. In this article, 
        we'll take a look at SQuirreL SQL Client which lets a user interact with 
        various databases, including DB2 via JDBC. </font></P>

        SQL Client</b></SPAN><BR>
        SQuirreL SQL Client is a program written in Java that allows you to view 
        the contents of a database, issue SQL commands, and as you will see, perform 
        a number of other functions. The graphical front end is built to support 
        JDBC-compliant databases. This article demonstrates SQuirreL being used 
        with DB2 UDB. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A><SPAN class=atitle2><b>Supported 
        Java versions</b></SPAN></A><BR>
        To run SQuirreL SQL Client, you need to have a Java 1.3 installed. According 
        to the SQuirreL SQL Client Home Page, there have been problems reported 
        with using SQuirrel Client with version 1.3.0 of Java. While the application 
        works fine in Java 1.3.1, the "preferred" Java version is 1.4. Being a 
        Java program, SQuirreL carries with it the inherent ability to be run 
        on multiple platforms/operating systems. In this article, I'll specifically 
        address running SQuirreL in Windows. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A><SPAN class=atitle2><b>Installing 
        &amp; firing up SQuirreL</b></SPAN></A><BR>
        SQuirreL uses the IzPack Java Installer which makes the installation of 
        SQuirreL quite easy. At the time of writing this article, SQuirreL SQL 
        client was in version 1.1. Download the install JAR from <A href="http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/" 
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
      xmlns:dw="http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/">http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/</A> 
        and issue the command:</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><CODE>java -jar squirrel-sql-&lt;version&gt;-install.jar</CODE></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doing so will bring up a pretty 
        straightforward installation GUI that by default will install SQuirreL 
        to the directory: <CODE>C:\Program Files\SQuirreL SQL Client</CODE>. The 
        installation program will also allow you to add a shortcut to SQuirreL 
        to your Windows Start menu.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A><SPAN class=atitle2><b>A 
        database to play with</b></SPAN></A><BR>
        Before we start talking about the usage of SQuirreL, let's hit the DB2 
        command line processor to create a database that we can use to see what 
        SQuirreL can do for us:</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><CODE>db2 =&gt; create db squirrel</CODE></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, connect to the database. 
        I'll assume that your username and password are db2admin and db2admin 
        respectively:</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><CODE>db2 =&gt; connect to 
        squirrel user db2admin using db2admin</CODE></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, we'll create a table. 
        For demonstration purposes, the table will be kept simple. The variety 
        of column types in the table is intentional to show you the ability of 
        SQuirreL to distinguish between the different column types.</font></P>

        When you start up SQuirreL SQL Client, you'll see a Drivers window that 
        shows you the myriad of databases that the Client supports. SQuirreL intelligently 
        detects if the JDBC driver for a given database is in your classpath; 
        if not, you'll see an "X" next to the driver.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you installed DB2, the 
        DB2 JDBC driver, db2java.zip, should have been added to your classpath 
        automatically. If you are using DB2 V8, this db2java.zip file will be 
        the correct driver. If you are using DB2 7.2, you may need to run the 
        usejdbc2 script file to change the default JDBC level of the driver from 
        JDBC 1.0 to 2.0. SQuirreL detects the existence of db2java.zip in your 
        classpath; consequently, you should see a check mark by IBM DB2 App Driver 
        in the drivers list (see <A

        The SQuirreL client leverages a database's JDBC driver to facilitate conversation 
        with a database. Officially, the client supports a myriad of database 
        products, including the major players: IBM DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL 
        Server, Informix, Sybase, and MySQL. The beauty of the client is that 
        in the rare instance that you are dealing with a database that SQuirreL 
        client does not support "out of the box," you are not out of luck. If 
        there is a JDBC 2.0 available driver for your database, you can register 
        the database manually with the client.</font></P>

        SQuirreL SQL Client allows for users to install and create plugins that 
        are designed to augment the functionality of the base application. There 
        are a number of plugins available for download on the SQuirreL SQL Client 
        Home Page. One of the plugins I found quite interesting was developed 
        by the head developer, Colin Bell. The plugin, called SQL Validator, allows 
        you to validate the SQL commands you issue against the ISO SQL standard. 
        The plugin interacts with a Web Service to do its validation work.</font></P>

        I was quite impressed by the ease of install of the SQuirreL Client. I 
        was up and running in a matter of 5 minutes. This was a considerable feat 
        considering the fact that I didn't read the manual. As I work with a number 
        of database flavors in any given day, SQuirreL Client is a blessing. The 
        application has been successfully tested with a number of database vendors, 
        including IBM DB2. It is pretty fast and not too big or resource hungry. 
        Support for the client can be acquired through mailing lists which can 
        one can subscribe to via the SQuirrel Client home page.</font></P>

        SQuirreL Client has the backing of a number of developers who offer their 
        philanthropic coding talent to enhance the application. The open source 
        application is under constant construction and improvement. As it is already 
        a powerful offering, it will be interesting to see what future versions 
        of the application will bring. The development team for the SQuirreL Client 
        openly solicits new contributors to join the development effort. Another 
        interesting open source project that is closely associated with SQuirreL 
        is called JFaceDbc. You can learn more about this project on the JFaceDbc 
        home page at <A 
      href="http://jfacedbc.sourceforge.net/" 
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
      xmlns:dw="http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/">http://jfacedbc.sourceforge.net/</A>. 
        The JFaceDbc SQL client tool is powered by the low level SQL code of SQuirreL 
        and instead of using the Java Swing API for its visual display, uses the 
        Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) of the Eclipse Project. </font></P>
